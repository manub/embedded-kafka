# scalatest-embedded-kafka
A library that provides an in-memory Kafka broker to run your ScalaTest specs against. It uses Kafka 0.10.0.0 and ZooKeeper 3.4.7.

The version supporting Kafka 0.8.x can be found [here](https://github.com/manub/scalatest-embedded-kafka/tree/kafka-0.8) - *this is no longer actively supported, although I'll be happy to accept PRs and produce releases.* 

Inspired by https://github.com/chbatey/kafka-unit

## How to use

scalatest-embedded-kafka is available on Bintray and Maven Central, compiled for both Scala 2.10 and 2.11

* In your `build.sbt` file add the following dependency: `"net.manub" %% "scalatest-embedded-kafka" % "0.6.1" % "test"`
* Have your `Spec` extend the `EmbeddedKafka` trait.
* Enclose the code that needs a running instance of Kafka within the `withRunningKafka` closure.

        class MySpec extends WordSpec with EmbeddedKafka {
    
        "runs with embedded kafka" should {

            withRunningKafka {
                // ... code goes here
            }
        
        }

* In-memory Zookeeper and Kafka will be instantiated respectively on port 6000 and 6001 and automatically shutdown at the end of the test.

### Use without the `withRunningKafka` method

A `EmbeddedKafka` companion object is provided for usage without the `EmbeddedKafka` trait. Zookeeper and Kafka can be started an stopped in a programmatic way.

        class MySpec extends WordSpec {
    
        "runs with embedded kafka" should {
        
            EmbeddedKafka.start()
            
            // ... code goes here
            
            EmbeddedKafka.stop() 
        
        }
        
Please note that in order to avoid Kafka instances not shutting down properly, it's recommended to call `EmbeddedKafka.stop()` in a `after` block or in a similar teardown logic. 

## Configuration

It's possible to change the ports on which Zookeeper and Kafka are started by providing an implicit `EmbeddedKafkaConfig`

        class MySpec extends WordSpec with EmbeddedKafka {
    
        "runs with embedded kafka on a specific port" should {

            implicit val config = EmbeddedKafkaConfig(kafkaPort = 12345)

            withRunningKafka {
                // now a kafka broker is listening on port 12345
            }
        
        }
        
This works for both `withRunningKafka` and `EmbeddedKafka.start()`

Also, it is now possible to provide custom properties to the broker while starting Kafka. `EmbeddedKafkaConfig` has a 
`customBrokerProperties` field which can be used to provide extra properties contained in a `Map[String, String]`.
Those properties will be added to the broker configuration, however some properties are set by the library itself and 
in case of conflict the library values will take precedence. Please look at the source code to see what this properties
are.
        
## Utility methods

The `EmbeddedKafka` trait provides also some utility methods to interact with the embedded kafka, in order to set preconditions or verifications in your specs:

        def publishToKafka(topic: String, message: String): Unit
        
        def consumeFirstMessageFrom(topic: String): String

        def createCustomTopic(topic: String, topicConfig: Map[String,String], partitions: Int, replicationFactor: Int): Unit
        
## Custom producers

It is possible to create producers for custom types in two ways:

* Using the syntax `aKafkaProducer thatSerializesValuesWith classOf[Serializer[V]]`. This will return a `KafkaProducer[String, V]`
* Using the syntax `aKafkaProducer[V]`. This will return a `KafkaProducer[String, V]`, using an implicit `Serializer[V]`.

For more information about how to use the utility methods, you can either look at the Scaladocs or at the tests of this project.
